As a result , they were transferred to different prisons . Orlando Azcu and two others were taken to Kilo 7 Maximum Security Prison in Camaguey where , on 17 January , they went on hunger - strike . They were said to have been forcibly dressed in the prison uniform and held for at least 17 days with their %%arms%% chained to the cell bars to prevent them from removing the uniform . Orlando Azcu was also said to have been beaten by prison guards on at least three occasions . In early February he was transferred to Pinar del Ro Provincial Prison after agreeing to give up his protest and end his hunger - strike .

I have very unpleasant recollections of sitting for him , for it was of utmost importance not to move but to fix him right in the eye and listen to him complain , saying as he always did that he was getting nowhere . It was not much fun , particularly at my age Things would deteriorate rather quickly , for Alberto would return to his hotel in the evening with a sculpture eight to twelve inches tall under his %%arm%% and come back the next day with a piece no more than three or four inches high I later realized that I had posed during a crucial period , and the tiny bronzes that resulted ( for that size prevailed ) continue daily to touch me . Another example from the 1980s allows us to hear a conversation between the critic Norbert Lynton and the painter Ken Kiff .

The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student , and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece . The most important thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range . It 's not much use arriving somewhere at ten in the morning clutching the collected works under your %%arm%% and wishing you had a wig and been born thirty years earlier in order to play Lear or for that matter the Duke of Gloucester . Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare , but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII , who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest . If you do want to portray an older figure , it would be preferable to try Hermione in The Winter 's Tale she is a more fantastical character , without the added complications of historical authenticity , and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation .

It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence . But the political significance of this culture is that where opinion counts and where the catholic nationalist remnant actually experiences the coercive power of protestant loyalists and the British army in the Northern statelet , there violence has all the more support . When it does , it tends to be a reaction to perceived injustice , such as internment without trial , or the conviction of a son by a sole judge in a trial held in total secrecy and on the evidence of unseen witnesses , or a simple case of one 's house being badly mauled by careless soldiers searching for %%arms%% . This reactive violence is thus justified by its subjects and the justification subsists in consciousness along with their Roman catholic profession of faith and identity . The provisional IRA 's commitment to violence against the British and against the protestant loyalist alliance , which the provisionals rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term the British , is frequently assumed to be based on either Marxist or nationalist principles and in both cases to be secularist or areligious .

It is important to practise adjusting the airbrakes during the float and to kick yourself hard if you ever land short of your point with brake still applied . It simply means that you have frozen on the airbrake lever and have undershot when you could have saved the situation . This is the same as throttle %%arm%% paralysis on a powered aircraft when the pilot undershoots and crashes his aircraft . He could have pushed the throttle forwards and avoided the accident by using the engine . It is also worthwhile attempting the occasional no airbrake touch down to get a better idea of how far your glider will float .

Such special knowledge holds further difficulties , for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account of such an institution , bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account . Ethical problems will surface , for no power - based organization likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public , and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic . Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition , for as the revelations of Spycatcher ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 ) revealed , it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ; rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various %%arms%% of the executive to say nothing about their practices . This returns us to Arendt 's observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism , for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance . The insider/anthropologist is therefore somewhat schizophrenic , something of a Jekyll and Hyde , for he knows that publication and explication might be career - suicidal but are necessary intellectual tasks .

In their own research departments the police continuously attempt to measure aspects of their activity , largely to demonstrate cost effectiveness in line with criteria imposed by the limits on public spending ( HO Circular 114/83 ) and the prevalent socio - economic world view of society . This has meant that many studies tend to concentrate on the objective assessment of a fiscally quantifiable reality . For example , the Audit Commission ( an %%arm%% of the treasury ) spent some time in 1987/8 with myself and others in a police research department assessing an OSU ( Operational Support Unit ) administrative system which they claimed had revolutionized police decision making and released manpower for patrol equal to 6.358 million . However , a colleague looking at these OSUs in relation to their cultural impact , saw there were many aspects of a qualitative nature which could not easily be expressed in fiscal terms ( Adams 1988 : 11 ) : direct submission of reports to the 0 .

Since this condemnation of research opportunity , few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture , and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research , I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's account , for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables . Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields , it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher , or in accepting his critical findings . And certainly that other main %%arm%% of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures remains negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile , as Reiner ( 1985 ) suggests , the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace , and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy . This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

Arm movement Economy of %%arm%% movement is important since the more you flail them about , the longer it takes to cock them for an effective punch .

The second requirement is that of good timing . Some competitors just are n't quick enough off the mark , or they hold back instead of thrusting in strongly .

To do this you slide back your rear foot so that the stance lengthens ( this makes it more stable in a longitudinal direction ) and your centre of gravity drops . If the action is sharp enough your opponent 's punch will graze over the top of your head , helped on its way by a fast rising block . As well as dealing with the punch , the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catching him high on the attacking %%arm%% . Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's other fist . There is no need to withdraw your blocking arm fully as you reverse punch ; you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway !

Even if the slide is not feasible , you can still throw your centre of gravity forward , so that weight increases on the leading leg . The fifth attention - grabber is the exaggerated hip action which should accompany every punch . This shows that the punch is not merely an %%arm%% movement , but a powerful , co - ordinated body action . The punching hip , be it the leading hip of a front punch or the trailing hip of a reverse punch , must swivel forwards , so that your centre - line directly faces the opponent . You may well decide to twist even further when using the front punch , but beware that your situation is weakened should the opponent immediately counter attack .

The back fist This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one . The back fist unrolls from the shoulder , propelled as much by the body turning away as by the %%arm%% action itself . Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action . A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .

Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the %%arm%% action . A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough . Nevertheless it remains an excellent opening strike because , even more than the snap punch , it cocks the hips for a powerful reverse punch .

Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range , and raise your other hand as a guard . Unfortunately , the cocking action that begins a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent . The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended %%arm%% is sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . The question is , how do you disguise the elbow flexion ? One answer is to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .

Also , the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction , so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach him. By that time , of course , the element of surprise is lost and his guard is ready and waiting . The remainder of the sequence then degenerates into a mle of pumping %%arms%% and legs . The hook At this point it is necessary to distinguish between foot sweeps and hooks .

If they took a whirl at the minister , he would have a fine sight of the fun . Two days ago when they had carted out Menzies the minister and Fleming the young teacher from along the road at Dull and danced round them like children at a Halloween fire and stuck them up on horses , facing backwards , and paraded them past the door and down the road to Aberfeldy , he had flung a soft carrot himself and caught the man on the side of his face . He had deserved all he got was that what ministers and teachers were paid for ? to draw up the militia lists and condemn the young men to the barracks and the camps , to swamp fever in the Indies and their legs and %%arms%% blown off ? Young Donald his eyes were clear black - brown , like a lochan stained with peat , his hair was curly like a bull 's poll , and he had been a lovely lad until his father went away , clever with his hands , whittling pieces of wood and glueing them to make little windmills and watermills . The wheel he had mounted on a bit of rod from Stewart 's smithy still turned freely in the burn at the side of the kail - yard .

Before the crowd could drift off , Cameron got up on the massive stone gate - post and called on them to swear an oath .

But they had meant it , and he was eager now to bring everybody together in a fine , hard point of resolve , in case zeal slackened and died away in the holiday atmosphere of this soft , comfortable afternoon . The hills themselves looked asleep , the heather glowed dust - blue in the hazy light , and the people , after a night of little sleep and hours of walking and standing , now looked stunned as they sat on the grassy banks , leaned on dykes , or lay on their backs in the hayfields , munching oatcakes and drinking the last of their water .

The pectoralis minor lies underneath the pectoralis major and in almost all cases any reference to the pecs means the pectoralis major . The pecs respond fairly quickly regular training , especially the bench press . The main function of pecs is to adduct the %%arms%% ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body ) , that is they move the upper %%arms%% across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion , which draws the arm forwards and upwards , and shoulder extension , which draws the arm down and forwards . By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle .

The best exercises for developing width are wide grip pull - ups to the back of the neck and lat pull - downs .

The best exercises for developing width are wide grip pull - ups to the back of the neck and lat pull - downs . Exercises to develop thickness include seated rowing . bent - over rowing , T bar rowing and single %%arm%% rowing . These latter exercises also work the lower trapezius muscles and the rhomboids .

The skeletal width of the shoulders is hereditary but an illusion of breadth can be created by fully developing the shoulder muscles . These muscles are called the deltoids and have 3 heads ; anterior ( front ) , lateral ( side ) and posterior ( rear ) . The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint , and they are attached at one end to the upper %%arm%% and at the other end to 3 points to the front , top and back of the shoulder . The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front , the side and the rear . All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements , but the direction of the arm movement determines which head is being used the most .

Firstly , training the biceps is very enjoyable and the results are easily seen . Secondly , the biceps respond very quickly to training and are relatively easy to develop compared to the triceps . Upper %%arm%% training should be in the ratio of 3 : 2 for triceps to biceps . It is always best to train the triceps first because these are usually the least developed group . There are 3 heads to the triceps ; 2 of them have their origins on the humerus and the third originates on the shoulder blade .

At risk of seeming a killjoy , I would urge readers to think through the implications of all home - made safety devices which set out to resolve some well - acknowledged safety problem only to create others of a less obvious by more hazardous nature . Remembering that anything that bodes to threaten concentration in wood - machining is a prime risk , let us consider a router cutter revolving at anything up to 24,000rpm sitting midway between 12 highly unstably - sprung devices whose proper purpose in life is the support of wet laundry on a clothes line . It takes little imagination to foretell the likely consequences of just one peg disintegrating and flinging its spring or its free %%arm%% into the cutter gap during a pass ; or the possible knock - on effect ( s ) on the rest of the makeshift assembly and the astonished operator if this should happen . There have been better hold - down devices of a home - made nature in Woodworker in the past the best of them doubtless designed after some careful thoughts about an acceptable specification . Mr Wiseman does n't only have the safety of his hands to consider : in this case he might stand to lose his sight or sustain laceration from bits of flying clothespegs , blocks and cramps into the bargain .

In following Stravinsky 's guidelines , Ashton found many new , sometimes frivolous , ways of performing class - room steps . The corps de ballet neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes , raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg , before moving forwards . They travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relevs after breaking the rule that the %%arms%% never cross the centre line of the body and are always ( except in arabesque ) rounded . If Ashton 's Scnes de Ballet is compared with Balanchine 's Ballet Imperial , it will be seen that Balanchine rarely breaks away from the classical technique as practised in petipa 's day when Tchaikovsky wrote the music . Ashton , like Stravinsky , took into account the technical developments which had taken place .

Dancers easily understand how a series of swift pas de bourre courus ( i.e. running on the toes ) as danced by the Queen of the Wilis in Giselle , differs from the same step performed piqu ( i.e. each foot picked up sharply at each change of weight ) , as in many of petipa 's solos . But it is not always easy to decide which is the more appropriate , nor how the two ways mentioned can lead to other versions . for example , in her solo in Ashton 's Cinderella the Winter Fairy moves across the stage in a series of pas de bourre en tournant terre , the feet weaving their in - and - out pattern as the %%arms%% flick to and fro sparkling with frost . In Symphonic Variations , the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase . This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design ( see page 68 ) .

This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design ( see page 68 ) . One of the most beautiful uses of pas de bourre courus is when Ashton places his danseuse in her partner 's %%arms%% as she floats over the surface of the floor as if in a dream like ecstasy . It is a movement he has used many times and which is perhaps seen at its best in the pas de deux to the Meditation from Thai - s created for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley ; in A Month in the Country when Natalia dances with the Tutor to express her emotions ; and in Les Deux Pigeons in the final pas de deux , when the Young Man has returned to The Girl and tenderly dances with her in his arms ( see page 83 ) . It was this ability to display a ballerina 's apparent weightlessness and sheer joy in dance that was so impressive when the Spirits of the Air danced in Homage to the Queen , Ashton 's exquisite celebration of the 1952 Coronation which was danced by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes .

But such jumps can also travel some way forwards , backwards or sideways and can become sparklingly light when the knees are sharply bent upwards at the height of the jump . This is required of the Four Fairies , the Fairy Godmother and the Stars in Ashton 's Cinderella . However if this way of jumping from two feet to two feet had not been combined with well picked - up pas de bourre piqus and relevs retirs as well as extremely accurate , quick ports de bras with straighter and more angled than rounded %%arms%% , they would have seemed out of place . When moving dancers from two feet to one in both open and closed sissonnes , the choreographer can make the movements dart over the floor as Aurora does in her final solo in The Sleeping Beauty . In Les Patineurs and Les Rendezvous Ashton makes his dancers travel upwards as well in an effort to show off their abilities to keep up with the music and beat each other to the exit .

It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The Sleeping Beauty when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince 's grasp and holds the final attitude for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity . There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers . There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette appears to fly away in an arabesque before Siegfried seizes her %%arms%% and draws her body close to his in an embrace . There are also the exciting poses that come at the end of some of Ashton 's pas de deux as the two characters declare their love , for example , when Oberon cradles Titania in his arms at the end of The Dream and , even more excitingly , when Colas lifts Lise high on one arm it the end of their dance in Act II of La Fille Mai Garde as if to crown her queen of the harvest In some modern classical ballets too little attention is paid to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up as it were what has gone before .

For example : in Choros he focuses attention on many ancient Greek dance rituals and accents the playful use of movement whilst at the same time showing that such warlike , athletic courtship and other activities are a wonderful game to be played by the performers . In Consort Lessons these quick changes of aulement give much greater variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dances with four boys . More recently , in his The Sons of Horus he has found ways of incorporating the profiled attitudes and poses seen in ancient Egyptian designs with straight turned - in legs , elongated lines and angled %%arms%% , all in contrast to the turnedout legs and curving bodies of classical dance . As Ashton and MacMillan in many of their ballets , he has created a style appropriate to one particular ballet .

Petipa 's remark that without ports de bras the dancer is dumb is only one of the wise comments he made when working on his choreographic designs . Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture ( see page 58 ) . De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying : Only synchronisation of %%arms%% and legs will give symmetry to step and pose , strength to the jump , speed to the pirouettes , calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance . To ensure that his audience would appreciate each sentence in his dance , petipa usually repeated each at least twice and usually four times . But towards the end of the second or fourth repeat he made some small alteration in the ports de bras so that the dancer could move easily into the next sentence .

This is particularly noticeable in his variations for the Six fairies in The Sleeping Beauty . Petipa clearly reflects in dance the gift that each fairy brings to the Christening . The first Fairy is slow and gracious to denote Beauty ; she encircles her face with her hand and displays the line of her %%arm%% ( the traditional gesture for beauty ) . The Second Fairy brings Grace and dances slightly faster in such a way that she shows off the lines of her body as it faces forwards and then backwards ( the traditional gesture ) . The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty , just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .

The fact that the two leading English choreographers create so many unusual ports de bras as a means of expression is what has made so many Royal Ballet dancers so successful in ballets with a story .

Any untoward or awkward transition is immediately noticeable because it destroys the calm dignity that the human body needs if it is to be shown at its best . This does not mean that speed must be avoided , nor that the unexpected need offend the eye . A sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of legs or %%arms%% , or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design . Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros and Consort Lessons . In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes add a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .

The demi - caractre style has its roots in classical technique , but must be coloured by more clearly defined and individual movements which allow the dancers to show they are playing the part of some character who has some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognised as such . In other words they usually , dance classically from their feet to the waist and above that are free to express themselves as people of more definite behaviour , work , play and age ( de Valois in a lecture to teachers , 1947 ) . The head , body and %%arms%% of the characters portrayed should show the status they have in the society to which they belong whether it is rural , urban or fantastic , as well as their behaviour , customs , work or play . Dauberval 's La Fille Mal Gard ( 1789 ) was the first ballet in this style . Dauberval 's exclusion from the Acadmie Royale ( later the Paris Opera ) was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers , peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes , heroines and courts .

Bournonville coloured his ballets with movements characteristic of many different personalities and nationalities . In his particular style of demi - caractre dance he used classical footwork for most of the time but , from the waist upwards through the body , %%arms%% and head , he tried to convey how his performers worked and played in the environment to which they belonged . for example : in Napoli they were Italian , in Far from Denmark they were Danes influenced by the dance of South America . This way of creating more plebeian characters is fully demonstrated in Ashton 's comic masterpiece La Fille Mal Garde , where this style of dance is shown in two different aspects , the light - hearted yet technically highly expert dancing of Lise and Colas and the comically eccentric work of Alain and the Cock and Hens .

As traditional Italian dances are often sung , the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .

Spanish style The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's Don Quixote , most particularly in the famous pas de deux fur the ballerina and her partner . The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high , back slightly arched , %%arms%% in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes for Kitri or on demi - pointes for Basil . The brilliant bravura variation when Kitri springs lightly forwards sur les pointes whilst fanning herself and Basil attempts to make his zapateado ( heel - tapping ) appear authentic by the slightly crouching pose of his body , add even greater panache to their efforts . Swanhilda strikes similar poses with her mantilla and fan in Copplia and so do the Spanish dancers in Swan Lake .

The working leg is thrust outwards on the first beat of a bar , heels click and stamp to accent the appropriate beats . Although the solo danseuses perform sur les pointes , they still mark the appropriate beats by stabbing their toes into the floor , i.e. they dance a series of retirs passs forwards or backwards without descending and use typical Hungarian ports de bras . These are also strongly accented as the %%arms%% straighten into 2nd position before being bent , with hands sometimes clasped behind the head , sometimes placed akimbo on the waist or sometimes with one on the waist and the other behind the large bow at the back of the head - dress . The danseuses perform some of the traditional steps such as the sideways moving pas de bourre danced sur les pointes and the sideways cabrioie rarely used in classical ballet . The unusual feature of traditional Hungarian style is the strong distinction made between the two parts of most folk dances .

His interest in ports de bras nearly always produces something new to say , whether it is to tell a story , describe the characters and/or create a style exclusive to one work . Japanese The first of Ashton 's ballets in oriental style was Madame Chrysanthme , in which he utilised many traditional japanese gestures made more fascinating by emphasis of his dainty ballerina 's footwork .

It also conveys the mood and emotions of the Girl , a very rare happening in true folk dance . The participants in folk dance can and certainly do show elation . In La Fille Mal Garde Mother Simone does this when she triumphantly finishes her Clog Dance on the %%arms%% of her more graceful neighbours , just as all the guests but Alain do after the Betrothal and they all dance out , %%arms%% linked to celebrate . The gestures of such pastoral characters as Lise and Colas in La Fille Mal Garde have already been noted ( - see page 100 ) as well as that of Lise churning and helping her Mother to spin .

Fokine 's advice to those wishing to create the romantic style of dance was much as fur demi - caractre when he said : The choreographer should base his design on classical technique from the feet to the waist , but above that the dancer 's head , body and arms must be free to express the moods , emotions and actions of the character in the story or theme to be communicated . This style was first created by Taglioni for his daughter Marie . The tale of La Sylphide gave him an opportunity to exploit her expressive %%arms%% and face as well as her ability to dance sur les pointes . Perrot developed the style in his dances fur Carlotta Grisi in Giselle . It was then expanded by Fokine and used in both grave and gay moods in Les Sylphides and Le Carnaval , where it is particularly expressive of both meaning and music .

Ondine , the sea nymph ( Margot Fonteyn ) so used her feet that she appeared always to float through water . This was done by a series of pas marchs each of which softly rose and fell through her feet from toe to heel . They were co - ordinated with a soft undulating movement of the %%arms%% . Ashton thus created a special style fur a particular character which summed up as it were her whole being , but which would have been unsuitable for any other ballet . B Once Fokine had demonstrated that mimed dance and danced mime were the best materials to use in ballets where individual characters had to stand out from the rest of the cast , and particularly when true love did not run smoothly , other choreographers . followed suit .

He stood silent and still , watching the tragedy of the Poor Girl who was being rejected by the Rich Man .

The latter 's vicious slap on the child 's face explains more than any other gesture Natalia 's selfishness . Yet the Tutor 's capitulation to Natalia reveals her power over every man she meets as well as his failure to withstand her wiles . Ashton 's careful build - up to this climax makes Vera 's discovery of them in each other 's %%arms%% all the more poignant because she shows a child - like petulance at losing one she so longed to have for her own . It is so unlike Natalia 's reaction when finding the Tutor and Vera together . The Tutor remains a sympathetic character fur Vera , s sorrow at his departure is echoed by Kolia , Natalia 's son , when he too realises he is losing the only person who has tried to make him happy .

If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan , they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture . They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement . It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body , %%arms%% and head to express themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters . It is well known that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old Aurora , happy at her birthday , into the dreamy figure the Prince meets in the woodland glade and on to her final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to her responsibilities as Queen - to - be . The enchanements she dances thoughout the three scenes do not change in style or content .

Yet if the dances of Vera and Natalia in A Month in the Country and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet are examined it will be discovered how the technical content is so designed that the steps , poses and gestures show how changing circumstances are affecting the individuals . This is what Perrot first attempted with his five leitmotifs for Giselle ( see page 61 ) . Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his %%arms%% . It shows her growing emotional involvement and gradually seems to affect her every movement . This same tiny movement also appears when Vera begins to dance with the Tutor , but her movement is not so intense .

Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements , though tentative , are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris . The moment she encounters Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful . From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's %%arms%% are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris . Her movements then are equally purposeful but they are constricted and withdrawn , so that her father 's contemptuous rejection of her pleas and his throwing her to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in his eyes is sheer disobedience . It is her final passionate abandon on discovering Romeo 's body that demonstrates how overwhelming sorrow can destroy all sense of discipline over both body and mind .

The movements are more or less directed sideways , i.e. cart or effac , as in the dances fur Romeo , Mercutio and Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet and fur the Tutor in A Month in the Country . 4 Sideways closed ( crois ) If the character moves sideways with the head , body and %%arms%% in some way averted from the front , i.e. crois , possibly with a twist of the shoulders , he or she is usually playing some evil or cunning person . One of the finest examples used to be de Valois ' dance for the Three Comforters in Job .

By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion , Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen . The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers ' bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated . Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their %%arms%% and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile . The angles made at the elbows , shoulders , knees and ankle joints are clearly visible . Those of the arms are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves .

Technical characteristics It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself . Only when they have examined what hands , %%arms%% , legs and feet , body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story , theme or music , can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture , with the right quality , mood , emotion , action and character . The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and , when needed , help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole . Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story , theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .

If the Goddess of Democracy symbolised a vision of China alien to the Communist Party , the new figures are equally alien to the students : the obedience of the intellectual and unflinching solidarity of the workers , peasants and soldiers .

The official blurb explains that the plaster figures stand as if boldly forging ahead , their eyes fixed on our motherland 's beautiful future . Perhaps unwittingly , the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph : the worker , the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City , the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation , but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai , the walled compound where party leaders live and work .

Conferred temporary and somewhat metaphysical diplomatic immunity by the embrace , the would - be emigrant and the diplomat walked , with their %%arms%% on each others ' shoulders , into the embassy . For many of the East Germans arriving in Prague , there is a unique emotional wrench when the time comes to make their way to the embassy doors . Every one of the scores of abandoned Trabants and Wartburgs which clog the streets around the embassy has been one of the most cherished possessions in its owner 's life .

As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta , at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies . Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years , now in the United States , he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals . Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in performance of movements ; the poising of an %%arm%% , for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued , with increasing sophistication , after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam . He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .

And if there is still no president when the current assembly session expires in December 1990 , the very mechanism that is intended to ensure the continuation of the Lebanese state will cease to exist .

Weapons have flooded into the country since the 1860s when the Royal Navy delivered %%arms%% to the Druze . Syria is still supplying guns to the Muslims , just as Iraq is supplying guns to the Christians . It is the task of Lakhdar Ibrahimi , the Arab League envoy , to struggle through a tangle of sub - issues in the hope that he can persuade the Lebanese to renegotiate France 's political legacy and the policies that began when General Henri Gouraud , who became the French high commissioner of Lebanon in 1920 , stepped ashore .

And , as Mao 's reputation slipped , so too did Chen 's . In 1966 , however , when Mao began his dramatic bid for absolute power , using young Red Guards to discredit and persecute his old rivals within the party , Chen again rose to the occasion , acting as a mouthpiece for Mao 's increasingly scrambled thoughts and policies . Chen is even said to have written , or at least supervised at Mao 's behest , the Cultural Revolution 's best - known tract an hysterical call to %%arms%% against counter - revolutionaries printed in the People 's Daily in April 1966 under the title Sweep away all ghosts and monsters . To carry out a wholesale purge of the party apparatus , Mao appointed Chen as head of the Cultural Revolution Group , a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciples , including Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , that was to lead the assault on the party hierarchy . The group was finally disbanded in 1969 , by which time China had been plunged into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .

Police tried to pull away refugees climbing over the embassy 's back fence last night , but they moved aside when the West German ambassador , Hermann Huber , appeared in the garden and said : Let them go !

As dawn broke yesterday , the same group , this time led by a mother with a baby in %%arms%% , faced down the police patrols and reached the embassy successfully . On Sunday West Germany had complained about the police presence around its embassy , and the slackening of restrictions is thought to have reflected an apparent Czechoslovak desire to remain as far as possible on good terms with both Germanies . West Germany has so far denied , although with a detectable degree of ambiguity , that any deal was made , preferring to point to the humanitarian reasons for allowing an evacuation of the embassy , and the pressure supposedly exerted on East Germany by the Soviet Union to bring the occupation to a speedy end .

If Mr Gorbachev believed he could acquire a breathing space through repression , during which the economy could be transformed by unpopular but necessary reforms , he might be willing to pay the price , but this would reverse his strategy of the past three years .

To crush strikes and abandon political reform would be to throw himself into the %%arms%% of those groups wedded not just to authoritarian politics but to neo - Stalinist economic institutions and principles . At which point Mr Gorbachev 's strategy of turning the USSR into a prosperous society in which intelligent Russians can take pride will be doomed .

THE City is braced for further nervous trading in both currencies and shares this week but most analysts expect interest rates to stay at 15 per cent despite yesterday 's slump in the value of the pound . As the pound slid through the important benchmark of DM3 to close at DM2.9737 and lost ground against the dollar , most analysts agreed that the Chancellor would resist a further hike in interest rates at least for the duration of the Conservative Party conference , and possibly for some weeks to come . A typical comment came from Bob Semple of County NatWest , the stockbroking %%arm%% of National Westminster . I do n't think interest rates will go up again . The Chancellor has no option but to sit and wait , he said .

Since the Vietnamese withdrawal , the two non - communist resistance factions - the Khmer Peoples National Liberation Front ( KPNLF ) and the Sihanoukists - have mounted a big offensive with an even bigger publicity campaign to boost their credibility . The Khmer Rouge has done nothing , because it has no need to prove anything . Its %%arms%% supplies from China are assured . Speculation that its soldiers would attack the town of Pailin on the Thai border has died down , as it became clear that to hold Pailin would be more of a liability than an asset . It would tie down a lot of troops and would also give Phnom Penh the opportunity to raise international alarm at the spectre of the return of the Khmer Rouge .

The calculation is that increased pressure on Hun Sen will force him back to the negotiating table , ready to make the dreaded concession : the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in a political settlement . The main supporters of the Khmer Rouge are the Chinese , who kept advisers in Phnom Penh throughout the Pol Pot era , and now supply the guerrillas with arms and money . The Chinese want to put pressure on Vietnam , and Peking has made clear that it will continue sending %%arms%% until the Vietnamese - installed government of Hun Sen agrees to some form of power - sharing that includes the Khmer Rouge . The Khmer Rouge says it has changed , and now supports a free market economy and a multi - party system . Given the conviction of Khmer Rouge members that they are the only people who can save Cambodia , few observers believe their commitment to multi - partyism would last for long .

The women admittedly conform to standard dancerly mould , and it is an awkwardness in the piece that little of its clowning comes from them . But the men look , refreshingly , as if they have spent years away from the studio mirror . There is a tragic buffoon with bald pate and flowing hair ; a short , bespectacled man entering a grey and paunchy middle age ; and Gallotta himself , who patters manically around the stage , fixing the dancers with an unfocused glare , while waving his %%arms%% and muttering instructions down a microphone . When Gallotta works up steam he has the dancers going through some startlingly slick paces polished dance routines , split - second falls and lifts and a brisk formation crawl . But this adroitness is constantly fighting against a humanly disruptive counterpoint .

I 've got a nasty feeling he may need to jack up interest rates further , but possibly not for very long . The fall in London , most of which took place in the afternoon , was triggered by a combination of factors . These included a pessimistic forecast from BZW , the stockbroking %%arm%% of Barclays Bank . In the BZW forecast , Peter Thomson said the FT - SE index should be back to 2,100 - 2,200 by the end of this month and would at best hold its own next year but more likely fall to 1,800 , where it started this year . Mr Thomson also said the Government 's aims of controlling inflation would put pressure on company profits and make a share prices surge in the winter/spring unlikely .

Detectives are working on the theory that the bags had been there for some time . If the IRA is involved , they may have been dumped after the discovery of an IRA bomb factory in Clapham , south London , last December , in which 150lb of Semtex , %%arms%% and other equipment were discovered , with a list of 100 potential targets . Subsequently , 22lb of Semtex was found dumped in water filter beds in Stoke Newington , north London , and then 25lb of Semtex and some firearms were found near Scarborough , North Yorkshire . Detectives named two men sought in connection with Clapham as Patrick Sheehy and John Conaghty , who are believed to have been the core of a cell of about five or six .

He advocated an approach of saying , Yes , but , rather than No , perhaps , in relation to the European Community . For example , on the controversy over the removal of frontier controls , Britain 's Commissioner proposed that controls should be replaced with police and Customs officer powers to check any traveller on suspicion of drugs or terrorist offences . The Government has been resisting the removal of frontier controls because of anxieties about drugs and illicit %%arms%% traffickers . On the EMS , Sir Leon said that the Government 's primary criterion for entry - that of falling inflation had already been met . He strongly applauded the decision by Nigel Lawson , the Chancellor , to raise interest rates last week , and argued that a sharper rise of two percentage points might have been more immediately effective .

Today England , having demolished a Railways XI containing no opposition of any note , take on a team sponsored by Air India , which looks almost as weak . The locals field one former Test player , Madan Lal , and although Maninder Singh last seen being swept to oblivion by Gooch in the Bombay World Cup semi - final was practising at the England net yesterday , he has yet to come to terms with an attack of the yips . It is a problem which seems curiously common to left - %%arm%% spinners , and manifests itself with the bowler either failing to release the ball , or propelling it vertically into the air . It finished ( as a bowler ) the former Derbyshire player , Fred Swarbrook , who gave up the unequal struggle when , peering frantically around to see where a delivery had gone , he found out only when the ball dropped out of the stratosphere and hit him on top of the head . All three of England 's players who did not play against the Railways on Wednesday Gladstone Small , Eddie Hemmings and Alec Stewart get a game today , although there is a slight doubt about Phillip DeFreitas , who suffered a reaction to an elbow injury sustained during fielding practice .

The Army ordered sentries to wear flak jackets and constructed many sandbagged emplacements , although most barracks were still protected by little more than chain link fences . The IRA did not choose to attack again until March 1987 . A possible reason is that it was difficult to get %%arms%% and ammunition to the right place , despite the virtual absence of border controls between Germany and its western neighbours . Communication with an active service unit two to 10 terrorists far from Ireland was a further obstacle . Another reason could be that the IRA had become aware of British intelligence 's drive for informers .

With respect to the latter , for example , women are no longer excluded from night duty and they perform a wider range of section duties than before . However , ordinary policewomen tend to feel that there are constraints upon equal opportunities within the force . Some of these are official , in that senior managers do not allow policewomen to carry %%arms%% , from which follows some restrictions on where policewomen cam be stationed , and on their involvement in high - profile political policing , such as at riots . Most of the constraints , however , are informal . With relatively so few policewomen , the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine , and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .
