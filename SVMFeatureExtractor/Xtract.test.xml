 Indeed , if the story enacted in a picture is not known , quite wrong inferences can be drawn from what is perceived . The reader of a description needs therefore to be careful about accepting as a description anything more than is actually visible on the canvas or in the sculpture . Within a particular culture , a description can naturally go further in identifying a devout picture of a Virgin and Child , or a dancing figure with six %%arms%% as Siva . The Christian painting may be at once a holy picture and a convincing representation of a woman tenderly cradling her son , seen in front of a north Italian landscape . The Siva statue has no such direct representational reference .

 The Fox in Holgate Road , York was an outstanding beneficiary of the Tetley Heritage Pub initiative of that time . It is a quite perfect example of pub conservation , combining careful preservation of the Victorian compartmented interior and servery arrangement , with judicious enhancement and enlargement of drinking areas . This kind of move came at a time when Tetley 's , along with other %%arms%% of Allied Breweries , espoused and encouraged a culture of well - informed and caring in - house designers . Times change , however , and today , under a somewhat different corporate regime , Heritage starts to smack of yesterday 's fashion , and one is not entirely sure what commitment remains . Already the other Tetley Heritage Pub in York , The Swan , is out on lease to an independent retailing chain .

 AEROBICS ON A SADDLE Having stamina , the ability to keep the body going , means having efficient muscles , good circulation and a strong heart . Exercises which are good for building stamina involve moving your %%arms%% or legs rhythmically . This creates a demand for oxygen , so the heart works a little harder , and the lungs are fully used . They pump oxygen into the bloodstream , so that it passes through the heart and reaches the working muscles .

 If the philosophical discontinuity Foucault describes is truly occurring , then an inside or reflexive exploration of police practice should reveal the strength of these divisive classificatory techniques , for any binary separation of man by his contemporaries into the non - human categories suggested by Leach ( 1982 ) is the very stuff of anthropology . And if such a classificatory system is a major feature of the way the police control their fellow citizens , then it seems essential it should be identified , assessed , and described . Foucault ( 1980 ) , like Thompson ( 1980 ) , asserts that the criminal justice system is increasingly becoming an %%arm%% of the state apparatus , with the institution of policing beginning to wield expanding socio - political power . In a liberal democracy this needs to be scrutinized constantly , and herein lies the first problem for the researcher . For how can one really study a system of state control without acknowledging that such an activity itself is antithetical to the direction of power ?

 Given this premise , we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards ; it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents ' Association conference not only supporting this motion , but arguing for the creation of twenty - four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad . Always the call will be for more power to the organization , so that the 1989 cry of alarm from the Police Federation conference about private security firms is based more on a fear that areas of influence are being taken from the institution than on beliefs that such groups are incompetent . In a similar fashion , all the representative bodies of the police ACPO , the Superintendents ' Association , and the Police Federation were outraged at the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution of Offences Act in the mid - 1980s ; for one area of police power in the courts had been removed at one fell swoop and given to another %%arm%% of the executive . So although in a liberal democracy it would seem practical and even suitable for the police to have a say in the way order is defined and maintained , as Foucault ( 1970 ) and Douglas ( 1987 ) have shown , this will inevitably take on an expansionist line ; for anything other than bland support of the proposals of the institution will present a challenge or pose a threat . This dilemma generates the paradox I have outlined above , where intellectualism and graduate recruitment become prized commodities and are publicly sought after as the organization seeks to elaborate its professionalism , but are simultaneously denigrated .

This hooking action is important because it interferes with the opponent 's attempts to free his %%arm%% and keeps him closed off for a longer period .

 Having said that , if you weigh only 60 kg ( 132 lb ) and yet still manage to sit your 90 kg ( 198 lb ) opponent down with a solid thump to his mid - section , then the refereeing panel may well applaud your fervour with a full point . Obviously , you cannot rely on a hard landing in the case of face punches , so other means must be employed . Even in the case of front %%arm%% jabs , the distance travelled should be maximised and the action demonstrated as a thrust rather than a snap . Many valid front punches are not scored because they travel such short distances at high speed , and are snapped back before the panel can react . A thrusting action should accompany all linear punches and kicks , since it is believed to be related to potential power in a way that a snapping action is not.

 The machine does not need to know anything : it has to perform a task . ( For the functionalist , I should interject , knowledge is decomposable into tasks . ) Robot %%arms%% driven by digital computers can carry out instructions to , say , put a pyramid on the big block even if successful completion of the instructions means first removing a small block from the big one . This is a very sophisticated procedure , but only in the most metaphorical sense would we want to say that the computer has a theory of the external world . ( John Searle , the Reith Lecturer in 1984 , built up a critique of computational psychology around considerations such as these . )

 The pecs respond fairly quickly regular training , especially the bench press . The main function of pecs is to adduct the arms ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body ) , that is they move the upper arms across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion , which draws the %%arm%% forwards and upwards , and shoulder extension , which draws the arm down and forwards . By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle . To develop the pecs fully it is necessary to be aware of how much development there is already , and whether that development is well balanced .

 ( Weights can be attached to the waist to make the dips much harder . ) The use of cables , if available , is excellent for bringing out the definition at the centre of the chest ( origin ) due to the fact that they allow movement over the body 's centre - line without loss of tension . Pectoral decks emphasise the outer part of the pecs near the insertion into the humerus ( upper %%arm%% ) . They also relieve stress on the elbows . If women fully develop the lower pec muscles , the result is that the bust is pushed out by large underlying muscles , thus seeming larger .

 The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint , and they are attached at one end to the upper arm and at the other end to 3 points to the front , top and back of the shoulder . The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front , the side and the rear . All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements , but the direction of the %%arm%% movement determines which head is being used the most . The most impressive shoulder development shows an equal development of all 3 heads of the deltoids . However , this is not very easy to achieve .

 Fig. 6 Back muscles The lateral and posterior heads should always be trained with specific exercises . The best exercise for the lateral deltoid is dumb - bell side - lateral raises ( remember to only raise the %%arms%% to the horizontal because after this the upper trapezius will be used ) , The posterior deltoid is the least enjoyable to train , but should never be missed out . This head is worked hard by bent - over dumb - bell laterals or bent - over cable laterals if a cable cross - over machine is available . It is unlikely that you will need to train the anterior deltoid specifically , but if you do then the straight arm dumb - bell raises to the front are excellent .

 There are 3 heads to the triceps ; 2 of them have their origins on the humerus and the third originates on the shoulder blade . The group has a single tendon insertion below the elbow into the forearm . The function of the triceps is to straighten the arm , therefore at the end of each exercise the %%arms%% should be locked out straight . If this is not done then the full range of triceps movement has not been achieved and full contraction will not be carried out , thus inhibiting development . To develop more size heavy basic exercises must be done , for example close grip bench presses , reverse grip bench presses , dips , push - downs and lying extensions .

 If these definitions were put through a computer they would list five kinds of jumps , twenty - three pas de bourre , seven glissades and so on . The technical structure of each step and pose is known and years of practice in hundreds of class - rooms have produced principles of calm and - spacious movement . But technical descriptions only indicate the positions through which the feet and legs should move and at which moment they should co - ordinate with the %%arms%% as weight is transferred from one step and pose to the next . There are few , if any , suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot , theme and/or music . if choreographers wish to make their design more interesting they should attempt to give each step and pose some distinctive quality or unusual place in the design , which may or may not break the old conventions .

 The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty , just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .

 Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow . It breaks the continuity of the dance . Other practices that once held up the flow of the dance were the continual closing in 5th position before a new step and the continual moving of the %%arms%% through 1st position at every change of weight or during a ports de bras . This last convention is invaluable in early training because it helps to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and is also valuable in such ballets as Birthday Offering as it echoes the period and style of Glazounov 's music . But this would get very boring if used too often .

 Therefore in daily training it is customary for each exercise to be performed to the left and right , forwards and backwards . But even if a choreographer breaks such regularity when setting a classical ballet he usually balances the pattern made on the floor in one enchanement by another moving in the opposite direction . This balancing of floor patterns is also matched by the rise and fall of the dancers ' bodies , heads and %%arms%% . It is very noticeable in Petipa 's ballets , particularly in all the corps de ballet work of The Sleeping Beauty . Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .

 some actors today , notably Sir John Gielgud , use them when playing in classical drama and some eighty are still part of a dancer 's means of telling a story in classical style . They have become part of the spacious ports de bras used during the dance . They conform to the same technical rules as ports de bras and must appear to pass through the centre line of the %%arm%% from shoulder to finger - tips and move within the two circles drawn by the elbows and hands . Two of the best examples occur when the Lilac Fairy casts the spell that sends Aurora to sleep in The Sleeping Beauty , ( Until a prince comes , sees her , falls in love and kisses her awake . ' and when Siegfried swears to marry and save Odette after she has told him how the wicked Von Rothbart turned her into a Swan ( Swan Lake , Act 11 ) .

 In his Scottish dances Bournonville highlighted the Highland characteristic of an upwards lift from the floor on the first beat of a bar whereas in English and French dance the movement is downwards . This makes the Scottish footwork look very light and easy particularly as it is allied to the steps of petit and grand allegro he also used . Another important feature is the absolute co - ordination of the %%arms%% as they change in the ports de bras , often moving through the 1st position . The change usually occurs on the first beat of a bar or phrase , which eliminates any fussiness when the footwork is intricate . Ashton maintained these formal changes in his frivolous Scottish Rhapsody .

 If this is danced to 6/8 it leads to the very swift footwork needed fur Massine 's tarantella and Ashton 's version of the Italian pas de deux in Swan Lake , a miracle of timing and quick changes of auiement . This type of dancing to a dotted rhythm also leads to many steps where the dancers hop continuously on one leg holding the other firmly in attitude devant , retire , or stretched backwards . Like Scottish ports de bras , those of Italy are very simple , the %%arms%% changing places after each sequence of dotted steps or hops . As traditional Italian dances are often sung , the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase . This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .

 However when Fokine staged A Night of Egypt ( later Cleopatra ) he went a great deal further and developed a more particular Eastern style inspired by the performance of some Siamese dancers . He started by sketching numerous frescoes and statuettes he found in the Hermitage Museum , Leningrad . From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the %%arms%% and hands . Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the arms and hands , which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body , very often with a twist sideways at the waist . This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .

But his choreography is no longer like that of earlier demi - caractre styles such as that of the Chinese dance in The Nutcracker .

 This is shown vividly when , left finally alone , she strikes a dramatic pose of complete withdrawal from love and happiness . Dorabella 's playfulness is similar to that of Natalia 's ward , Vera , when she first dances in A Month in the Country , . The carefree quality disappears when she shyly tries to tell the Tutor how fond she has become of him , and when she discovers Natalia and the Tutor in each other 's %%arms%% , she loses all inhibitions to denounce them . Her shy confession of love is in deep contrast to that of Natalia , who cannot wait to show that her emotions are fully aroused when left alone with the same man. It is in these brief intimate scenes that Ashton exploits the difference between youth fulling in love and experience demanding it , because Natalia is used to getting her own way .

 Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile . The angles made at the elbows , shoulders , knees and ankle joints are clearly visible . Those of the %%arms%% are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves . The dancers drawing these straight , angled and very slightly rounded lines have to work accurately and be correctly aligned with their neighbours in each temporary grouping . Each grouping has to be correctly aligned with the other whether it precedes , balances or follows another .

 As US officials produced evidence of his involvement in drug trafficking and appealed for support from other Latin American countries in their campaign to oust him , their case was weakened by evidence that the US had been an important supporter in the general 's rise to power and that the CIA had known about his trafficking for years . Worse were the revelations that the CIA tolerated his activities and had continued to pay him 200,000 ( 125,000 ) a year for at least 10 years . At the same time , General Noriega had been flirting with the Soviet Union and , according to US intelligence sources , continues to receive %%arms%% from Moscow . In spite of the sharp recession induced by US economic sanctions , General Noriega has played a skilful game of counter - propaganda . He accused the US of attempting to destabilise him in order to revoke the Panama Canal treaty signed by the former US president , Jimmy Carter , and the then strongman of Panama , General Omar Torrijos under which control of the canal passes to Panama in the year 2000 .

 And the FBI said it had participated only to help fingerprint the victims ; yet there is an FBI report on the incident with over 200 pages blacked out for national security reasons .

Don Ewing , director of operations for Arrow , has acknowledged that the company carried %%arms%% from Portugal to the Nicaraguan rebels on at least two occasions in 1984 . And one of Arrow 's pilots , Jacobo Bolivar , was one of the three principals of Sur International , the company which flew weapons from the US to Iran for Lieutenant - Colonel Oliver North in 1985 . We need some people to be made to testify under oath so we can find out what went wrong with that investigation , said Mr Laframboise , stressing that , at this point , it does not matter that most of the physical evidence has been destroyed .

 The time and place for this palace is not fixed , though the women 's hats and swirling frocks remind us both of Dior and Watteau , the men are in chic , futuristic black chiffon . And this shifting between the past and almost - present is equally felt in the choreography it contains some of the cleanest , most authoritative classical dance Page has produced while simultaneously suggesting modern bodies and modern mores in the way the dancers loll negligently on the floor or challenge each other 's strength . On first viewing , the movement is too enjoyably dense to take in fully in old Page - style the head , torso and %%arms%% work in radical counterpoints to the legs , but their opposition is much less clamorous and wilful than before . Where the eye often used to be bruised by hectic entrances and exits , Page now keeps his dancers on the stage , shifting them around in complex patterns or gathering them up in long architectural phrases . Above all there is a new humanity in the work .

And , most importantly for the lads , judging by the roar which greeted its first appearance , he can still windmill his right %%arm%% .

 In the late 1970s British insurance brokers were takeover targets of their larger rivals in the United States . Then , in the 1980s , overseas financial groups have had large British insurance companies within their sights , which has led to aggressively fought takeovers . The wave of acquisitions has been prompted by expansionist desires among the overseas financial groups , which see opportunities to increase market share and provide themselves , in the case of the acquisition of insurance companies , with new marketing and product design %%arms%% . In some cases , overseas groups have just taken speculative shareholdings in British insurance companies in the hope that their interest may flush out other buyers . The latest , and the largest of the takeovers came last week with the offer of 1.1bn by Australian Mutual Provident , Australia 's largest life insurance company , for Pearl Group , a leading British life insurer .

Emma Nicholson 's Private Member 's Bill against hackers , which failed to make the grade in the last session of Parliament , required anyone who entered a computer to his or anyone else 's advantage , or to another 's prejudice , to be charged with a serious offence , with a maximum penalty of 10 years .

 Other stalling techniques are also deployed to detain them in the station on such days ( prolonging station business , extended conversations in parts of the station where they are less visible to management , carrying messages , and so on ) . But , as a general principle , Northern Ireland 's social divisions ensure that police management prefer neighbourhood police to be on the street , as is their purpose , and in practice about three - quarters of the normal shift is taken up with beat duty , which is much higher than in Great Britain . But there is a reverse to this , for wider security concerns require that neighbourhood men accomplish community policing equipped with at least a side - %%arm%% , sometimes more , flak jacket and baton , as well as personal radio . For some calls they wear plain clothes , but mostly work is done in uniform , as it must be if neighbourhood policing is to work . Moreover , each patch has to be walked by two men : one providing cover for the other while he polices his beat , so that each spends only half of the shift on their particular area .

Another point is also made explicitly . : his %%difficulty%% is assessing Czanne 's work at the end of the century . It is more difficult to be precise about this than about the earlier phases , partly because the pictures are rarer and less accessible , and have not been adequately photographed , partly because it includes considerable variations .

 A climate of artistic opinion is as tricky to predict as the English weather , and also quite as changeable .

One %%difficulty%% in describing a climate of opinion is this fact : that many shared views are not stated openly , but assumed .

 A play really demands to be read aloud - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .

Here is a suggested first reading list , which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's development . There is a danger in reading the classics , in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature so always try to look at them as plays for performance and , it goes without saying , try to see as much theatre as you can .

 This applies during any cross wind take - off . It also applies during the landing itself and the ground run , whether the wing - down or crabbing method is being used . As with all flying , anticipation prevents %%difficulties%% arising . At the start of the cross wind take - off apply full rudder in anticipation of the swing into wind , and then reduce it as soon as it becomes effective . Get the wing - tip holder to keep the down wind wing - tip high and apply a little aileron to prevent it falling during the first part of the take - off run .

 Jewish tradition said this about the education of the child : Scripture at five ; Mishnah ( that is , the explanation of the scriptures ; mishnah means repetition ) at 10 ; Bar Mitzvah at 13 .

Academically , he was a bright pupil , though it would appear he had %%difficulties%% in concentrating on the day - to - day routines perhaps through boredom , often an indication of the brighter child .

 I have declined to act as external examiner to candidates whose subject or thesis title seemed to be so dubious that a successful treatment of it could only be done by a candidate of exceptional brilliance ; in such cases it is likely that the candidate has had inadequate or misguided supervision . In a busy life , it is easier to avoid embarrassment than to have to extricate oneself from it . Much %%difficulty%% could be avoided if the only candidates permitted to work for a PhD were those who were virtually certain to obtain it , but that is not a feasible option in the modern university . Similar considerations make me sometimes decline to examine students from foreign parts . This is not because of xenophobia , still less racism ; prudence is the principal consideration .

 The problems are not universal , one must emphasize . Some students , particularly those from the Indian subcontinent who have been selected for Commonwealth Scholarships , are capable of performing very well at higher degree level , and then returning to an academic career in their own countries . When overseas students do present %%difficulties%% and I am sure many academics will be familiar with distressing or scandalous cases it is not because they are lacking in industry or intellectual ability . Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency , like linguistics or economics or marketing . But in this respect , at least , English in the English academy , as Leavis liked to emphasize , is not just another subject .

 How much can I covenant ? Covenant payments are made out of your income and are not capital payments . You could covenant all your taxable income if you wished remember though that a part of your total income will not be subject to tax , because of the various tax allowances you enjoy ( personal allowances , mortgage %%interest%% relief , etc. ) If you are planning to give a particularly large sum , it is always more advantageous to give out of income by covenant than to give a capital sum .

 For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to write a historical essay , but it was Barr 's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair . In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself , Barr 's commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art : The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent %%interest%% which human beings have in the fantastic , the irrational , the spontaneous , the marvellous , the enigmatic , and the dreamlike . These qualities have always been present in the metaphors and similes of poetry but they have been less frequent in painting , which in the past was largely concerned with reproducing external reality , with decoration , or , as in the more advanced movements of recent years , with the composition of color and line into formal design . On Dada he wrote : With robust iconoclastic humor the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .

 Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn , in his introduction to The Principles of Art History first published in 1915 . Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's successor as professor at Basel , but his later successful career took him to Berlin , Munich and Zrich , a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque . Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant of artists , but the famous phrase indicated an %%interest%% in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition . Wlflinn 's writings are strong on observation ; this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ; linear as against painterly , plane surface as against recessional depth , closed against open form , composite clarity against fused clarity , or absolute clarity against relative clarity . Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of Wlflinn 's pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books .

 In a number of places Pilinski completely misunderstood the indications of the original . THE SURVEY WITH A THEME Themes in art have a fascination , since they add a subject %%interest%% to a viewer 's enjoyment of artistic qualities . The portrait is an endlessly interesting example , a theme redolent with social connotations and artistic references . In Dostoevsky 's opinion , The portrait painter seeks the moment when the model looks most like himself ; in the capacity to find and hold this moment lies also the talent of the portraitist .

 This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's writing , since it tempts the rash into speculation , while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons . A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child . Again , much %%interest%% attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists . An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs to be considered as devotional imagery , and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

 Reading plays is an essential part of your career preparation the more plays you read the more you will understand of the theatre 's development . Academic study of drama as such is not necessarily useful for the actor , but an awareness of playwrights and their various styles is of practical value . A play is primary a piece of action and although a script contains some scenic and character description , the essential %%interest%% lies in the dialogue and the action arising from it . A play really demands to be read aloud - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive . It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .

 Also , there can be no doubt that the South would intervene in the North on behalf of the catholic nationalist minority if Britain withdrew and civil war broke out . Equally , Southern catholic nationalists prefer a unified Irish state , though a majority of 54 per cent would accept a federal one based on the present two state units . One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic nationalist population as a whole , though one in which certain groups , namely farming %%interests%% and the church , at both clerical and popular levels , have strategically dominated , at least until recently . By 1914 , the protestant loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary . Issues of class conflict within the group were to remain largely subordinate , as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day .

 Castle catholics , those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union , have also voted alliance , but are probably now , in 1989 , switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations , which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster . The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital interests , particularly as represented by the conservative party . But that is what the arrangement was : an alliance rather than a consolidated %%interest%% or a genuinely shared culture . Protestant loyalists dominated the statelet from its formation . The British government only obtained certain concessions from the Stormont government in implementing measures of the welfare state variety after 1944 .

 In 1927 , 1929 , 1956 , and 1960 , there were plenary synods and councils . Since then , the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year , but usually in secret sessions .

This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media , schools , cultural organizations , welfare services , and hospitals are duplicated , and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities .

 There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ; but it had been based on industrial workers , particularly in the shipyards , and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart . As Gibbon has noted , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material %%interests%% of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions . By providing core beliefs , and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances , religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions , become embroiled in cementing alliances , and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

 It proved to be a period of strained relations with the English liberals , who were allies of the Irish party , but who were also in favour of bringing schooling more and more under state rather than church control ( Miller 1973 : 817 , 12038 , 26892 ) . By this time , the schools frequented by Roman catholics in Ireland were also largely under the direct control of the church 's clerics . But secularizing moves by the English liberals over the Education Bills of 1902 , 1906 , and a private member 's Bill of 1911 led the Irish hierarchy to question some of the political intentions of the Irish politicians , who it was feared might sell out the church 's %%interest%% in schools . According to the Liberal - Irish alliance , the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill , aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control : that is , giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control . With the Irish party abstaining , both English and Irish Roman catholic bishops began to pressurize the leader of the Irish party , Redmond , and his associates to support the Conservative bill .

 In addition , Roman catholic schools in Ireland , in continuity with the belief and practice of Roman catholics in a number of other countries , have a different concept and practice of teaching religion in the schools from that of the majority of protestant traditions . This ranges from the presence of religious symbols in the classrooms and corridors of the schools to religious services such as mass or the saying of the rosary , and finally to the specific form of religious education which is praxis oriented .

 At the Saracen 's Head at Towcester , for example , a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail , such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns . In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs ' standard internal layout . Often the creation of the open plan interior requires the removal of walls , chimney breasts , stairs and other internal features of %%interest%% , which is highly destructive of the building 's historic character . The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior , even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn . In the most extreme cases the existing building is so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild is proposed .

 We contest that there are no laws written in stone , and that there is room for hybrids .

As was so chillingly illustrated by the postwar period of mass destruction and misconceived redevelopment , it is possible to throw the baby out with the bathwater .

One year older than Leonard , he went through the varying experiences of adolescence with him , sharing not least Leonard 's musical interest ( Morton played both the banjo and the trombone ) , as well as a variety of pastimes and a healthy interest in the fairer sex . Unlike Leonard , he had very little %%interest%% in the synagogue and broke from its traditions much more decisively , finding Leonard 's continuance somewhat irritating . ( Krantz is modelled on Rosengarten in The Favourite Game , though highly fictionalised . ) He was always impressed with Leonard 's room , which he found to resemble more a study than a youth 's bedroom already the style was evident .

 Nevertheless , he felt bound to accept the challenge of post - graduate work at Columbia University in New York , albeit with deepening reservations . Moreover , Dudek had taken his doctorate at Columbia , and Federico Garia Lorca had studied there a few years before Leonard was born . Almost immediately on arrival , surrounded by the cosmopolitan excitement of New York , its immense anonymity , the total lack of personal %%interest%% shown towards him after having been the centre of warmth and appreciation in Montreal , he knew that it was not for him. Columbia University 's Law School had no charms , no personal comfort ( like the surrounding high - rise buildings ) ; there must be another way . Paul Robeson himself a belatedly famed son of the Law School might embody law and song , and F.R. Scott might embody law and poetry , but even he recognised the more profound call of the muse : poetry first , he had said and the poetic element all the way through , which in the hurly - burly of the clothing industry , was even less possible .

 It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality , which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense . A contradiction in style during this change of aulement or alignment can distort the design . Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can add %%interest%% and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake ; it is Odile 's triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's heart . Even more exciting changes of aulement can be found in Ashton 's Birthday Offering where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle , without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .

 MacCabe and Heath had studied in Paris , and Signs of the Times has its niche in postwar cultural history , marking the first major re - entry of French intellectual influences since Eliot 's adherence to Remy de Gourmont and the French neoclassicists , half a century earlier . For the sake of convenience I shall apply the term la nouvelle critique to the complex of ideas emerging from the Paris of the 1960s , including many diverse strands : the classical structuralism of the early Barthes , the poststructuralism of his later work , the deconstructionism of Derrida , and whatever name one gives to the work of Foucault and Lacan , in taxonomic historiography and dissident psychoanalysis respectively . Frank Kermode was the first senior academic in English studies to take a sympathetic %%interest%% in la nouvelle critique , particularly its analysis of narrative . For some years before his move to Cambridge he chaired a seminar at University College London , which discussed the literary implications of structuralism , semiotics , and emergent poststructuralism . He has remarked , No other phase of my academic life has given me so much pleasure and instruction .

 In its new freedom , it can be seen to cause a new reality to come into being ( Hawkes 's italics ) . Or consider the density of trope and implication in the following : New New Criticism would thus claim to respond to literature 's essential nature in which signifiers are prised utterly free of signifieds , aiming , in its no - holds - barred encounter with the text , for a coherence and validity of response , not objectivity and truth ( Hawkes 's italics ) . Raymond Tallis has described this passage as being of great %%interest%% to the pathologist of modern literary theory . In certain respects , what Hawkes calls the New New Criticism had what looked like connections with the older version . Both were directed towards the formalist reading of literary texts , and some anglophone academics tried to minimize the strangeness of French imports by saying that la nouvelle critique was only offering a new version of what had long been familiar in the Anglo - American academy .

 The enthusiasm has , of course , been exploited , in the opportunistic launching of courses in women 's studies , and by the publishing industry which has filled the shelves of bookshops general as well as academic with books with women in their titles . One of the most interesting and welcome results of literary feminism has been the reprinting of forgotten texts , usually by women but occasionally by men . In an earlier Chapter I argued that the canon is bursting , because of the advent of other anglophone literatures , and the increasing %%interest%% in contemporary writing . Undoubtedly , the new availability of earlier texts of feminist interest is helping the explosion . At the same time , at the level of practical pedagogy , there is a counter - tendency in the study of the national canon to concentrate more and more on a small and diminishing number of texts .

 It is noticeable that though Derrida is a philosopher , albeit one interested in literature , and has always worked in an academic - philosophical context , even if on the margins of the subject , his major impact in North America has been in literature departments . Though some of his followers have philosophical training and interests , and are acquainted with the matrices of Derrida 's thought in Hegel , Husserl , and Heidegger , his transmission in literary and cultural contexts has meant that his ideas have become simplified , his paradoxes and contradictions tamed and diminished . One writer , whose %%interest%% in poststructuralism is primarily philosophical , has commented : the reception of Derrida 's work , perhaps more than that of any other recent French thinker , has been marked by an astonishingly casual and unquestioning acceptance of certain extremely condensed not to say sloganistic characterisations of the history of Western thought , as if this history could be dismissed through its reduction to a set of perfunctory dualisms . People in literature departments are not used to handling ideas , it not being their mtier , and traditionally they were not required to , beyond such elementary tokens as the Elizabethian World Picture or the Death of God .

 Thus , The Tempest is about colonialism ; not only The taming of the Shrew but King Lear and Measure for Measure are a focus for feminist readings ; while Henry V encodes a contemporary Elizabethan colonialist endeavour , the fantasy of a successful Irish campaign . These readings are intermittently illuminating , if reductive , and basically they are doing what criticism has always done , which is to interpret the works of the past in the terms and concepts of the critic 's own age . It is precisely this capacity for renewed interpretation that makes literature of more than simply historical %%interest%% . Latterday Marxist interpreters of Shakespeare are doing much the same as the conservative proponents of the Elizabethan World Picture did thirty or forty years ago , though with a different conceptual model . The contemporary New Historicists , however , are unlike interpreters of the past , in that they are concerned with exclusively political readings , without any possibility of aesthetic or affective responses .

 If this meant there were potential conflicts between research and pedagogy , that was a price that had to be paid . With the passing of time , the subject expanded further , institutional pressures became greater , and a gap widened between the professionals who taught literature and the poets , novelists , and dramatists , somewhere out in society , who wrote it , notwithstanding the increasing presence of contemporary literature as a university subject . In this last respect , American experience is significantly different ; writers - in - residence are common on campuses as teachers of creative writing , though literary theorists show little %%interest%% in what is being written . Donald Davie has suggested that one reason for the explosion of theory is that it provides a stamping ground for the innumerable people in departments of English ( also of French , of German , of Classics ) who have energy and intelligence but no literary sensibility . Davie 's provocative point is well taken .

 This current feeling for the past might provide a way in adult classes of shifting the emphasis from popular modern writing to earlier literature . Chaucer looked at in isolation can seem daunting , but Chaucer read in a cultural and historical context , with visual and other aids , could come alive as a great poet , speaking across six centuries , in a Gadamerian fusion of horizons . I am not , though , recommending the ideological antiquarianism of the New Historicism , which has little %%interest%% in poetry as such . This is a speculative proposal , merely , and it may fall foul of the fact that in our image - ridden culture reading is difficult , and literary texts still demand to be read , rigorously and carefully .

 BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson , the Master of the Rolls , as he opened the Bar 's annual conference in London at the weekend . Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , to give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitors , Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma , the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's Green Papers and to abandon the hustings . Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's Bill were total freedom of choice for the client , unless the %%interests%% of justice otherwise require . When those concerned turn their attention to this problem , they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available . In the first category we have criminal cases , judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disability .

 In many of them , particularly criminal cases , the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public . In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as , for example , that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands . In the second category , general civil cases , parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the %%interests%% of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice . Lord Donaldson implied , however , that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy . While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions , Lord Donaldson 's voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .

 The most substantial , Honour Hong Kong , is sponsored by many of the colony 's biggest companies .

It was suggested Goldsmith %%interests%% already had two per cent and were planning to build a significant shareholding to encourage the Grand Met board to consider a breakup . The stock market theory is that the Goldsmith contingent needs a new challenge now its bid for BAT Industries has effectively evaporated . The Goldsmith plan to break up BAT has been overtaken by BAT 's decision to do the job itself .

 Those who went have betrayed their country . Bonn 's principle that East Germans have an automatic right to West German citizenship and protection is revanchism , its refusal to turn refugees away from its embassies is a provocation . The decision to expel the first batch of embassy refugees to the West was a humanitarian act done in the %%interests%% of the many children involved and to avoid epidemics . The expellees have in any case isolated themselves from East German society , they are mindless strays , many of them are antisocial and the country is better off without them . A recent Protestant Church Synod , where speakers aired grievances and called for change , was a conspiracy to prepare the way for reunification .

 Aware of the strength of public opinion , Mrs Aquino ordered flags on government buildings to be flown at half mast in a conciliatory gesture . Yesterday she emphasised again that her decision was based on sensitive information that showed Marcos 's return could be destabilising . I am doing this in the %%interest%% of the great majority of our people , she said . A group of Marcos loyalists yesterday filed a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to reverse an earlier ruling that upheld Mrs Aquino 's decision to bar Marcos 's return . Mrs Aquino has said she will bow to its decision but is confident it will again rule in her favour .

 However , it is King 's work in Wales that is his great legacy . He was a frequent attender of the Chateau Gaillard European Castle Studies conferences , and contributed several papers to the published proceedings . He always had a deep %%interest%% in siege engines and the construction of scale working models of these machines ; one of the memorable events of the Chateau Gaillard conference at Durham University was witnessing David 's experiments with his machines on the campus lawns , using marbles for ammunition . In 1962 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and later , from 1976 to 1977 , he served as President of the Cambrian Archaelogical Association . In 1987 the University of Wales Press published a collection of essays written by his admirers in his honour .

 At one time Dalgety was up 16p as Elf Aquitaine , the French oil group , confirmed it had formed a joint company with Australian Robert Holmes a Court to hold a 5.5 per cent stake in the Dalgety agricultural and food group . The shares closed 12p higher at 436p . It is widely believed that Mr Holmes a Court , the so called Perth predator , is keen to buy Dalgety 's extensive Australian land %%interests%% . But the French connection is less clear . An Elf spokesman described the link as purely a financial investment .

 We hope we will give a voice to the authors of the '90s . The new company is a three - way partnership between the Chapman family ( his wife Marjory becomes editor - in - chief ) , a property and leisure group called Taylor Clark , and Associated Newspapers . The Mail and London Evening Standard group is to put its book publishing %%interests%% into Chapmans . The partners will each hold 31.1 per cent of the equity , and Chapmans will have an initial capital of around 2.5m . Sir David said that Associated would make further funds available for expansion .

 This would lead to a decline in the volume of less essential traffic in urban and rural areas and bring an overall reduction in all its adverse effects , including its contribution , through carbon dioxide , to global warming certain to be very high on the political agenda in the next few years . Such a tax could be introduced almost overnight . It could be raised if found to be effective in achieving public %%interest%% objectives . Moreover , it would not require the high administrative and technical costs of road pricing . History shows that the long - term effect of altering the price of motorised travel does not necessarily affect the amount of money people and organisations spend on transport .

 Caroline Willbourne , a London barrister specialising in family law , said decriminalisation of sexual offences within the family where the offender admitted the abuse was in the interests of child victims . Court proceedings should be of a civil rather than criminal nature , she said . You often find the civil court has dealt with the abuse and the perpetrator in the context of what is in the best %%interests%% of the child . But she added that prosecution and imprisonment by a criminal court did not serve the interests of the family as a whole , or of the child who remained part of it , or how victims would deal with contact with the abuser after release . Ms Willbourne also called for the civil courts to be given new powers to exclude an abuser from the home instead of the child .

 Shah said that he was later offered Edwards 's 51 per cent holding , which Knighton has agreed to buy for around 10m , but only on payment of a 6m premium . Shah made a counter offer , which expired last night , with a 1m premium . The former Today owner said he had seen documentation from Scottish financial institutions which put Knighton 's personal net worth at around 3m , and added : I think he should now step aside and let somebody in who has the %%interests%% of the club at heart . A confidant of Owen Oyston , the Lancashire businessman who owns the Miss World beauty competition business , said that Knighton and Oyston met at Manchester City 's Maine Road ground last Saturday . A proposition was put to Owen , and he is considering it , the source said .

 The most obvious manifestation of this came when he remained almost immobile in the centre of the ring while Biggs picked him off with jabs from long range . But Biggs also ran out of steam as the contest progressed towards the later rounds although he managed to conceal this inadequacy from the British champion . A delighted Mason could not be sure which punch ended Biggs 's %%interest%% in the proceedings and no one could be sure about the outcome as the bell approached . Before a demoralising defeat when challenging Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship two years ago Biggs would have probably been too dangerous a proposition for Mason but something has gone from him since then and he was unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertions . Both men took heavy blows and by withstanding the best of the American 's punches Mason at least emphasised that he has a strong enough chin .

Fred Walker , who still lives locally , will also retire as chairman . Their %%interests%% in the company are held in a family trust . The deal , which needs the approval of the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission , will give British Steel control over 35 per cent of the UK stockholding industry and 5 per cent of the European Community stockholding market . Stockholders account for 60 per cent of the 20 million tonnes of steel sold in the UK each year .

 Negotiations are likely to last into next month . A company request that the normally prolonged negotiations be concertina - ed into a week - long brain storming session has been rejected . On Wednesday leaders of 12,000 white - collar workers at Ford put in a similar claim plus a call for low %%interest%% mortgages and a car leasing scheme . The Ford Pay claim coincides with negotiations at Vauxhall where leaders of the 9,000 manual workers have turned down a two - year offer giving 9.1 per cent in the first year and inflation plus 3 in the second . Further talks are scheduled for 16 October .

 So long as there is a full right of appeal against a refusal of leave a right which the present Government sought , at one stage , to abolish this handicap is acceptable , even though it places public authorities in a more privileged position than the ordinary litigant . A less acceptable handicap is the special rule that the application for judicial review must normally be made within only three months from the decision complained of . It is in the public %%interest%% for challenges to the exercise of public powers to be made promptly , so that the administration and citizens alike know what the law is . But it is unjust that the individual 's right of access to the courts should be restricted solely on the ground that there has been delay in making the application . As the Law Commission recommended in 1976 , the test should be whether the granting of relief to an applicant who has delayed would cause substantial prejudice or hardship to any person or would be detrimental to good administration .

 Last night , United announced that Edwards was taking leading counsels ' advice as to the validity of his agreement with Knighton . Knighton has been in contact with several businessmen from the Manchester area in attempts to get wider backing for his 20m bid , which has hit financial snags . One of them , Eddy Shah , the former national newspaper owner , said he was no longer interested in a deal with Knighton , but another , Owen Oyston , a local radio - station owner and property entrepreneur , applied to the Football League for permission to obtain a financial %%interest%% in United . That could mean another football club gets involved in the United wheeler - dealing . Oyston is also chairman and owner of Blackpool Football Club , and is seeking the permission of the League to waive their rule that no one may hold more than 10 per cent of a club if he has a financial interest in another .

 This is a suitably slimmer volume on one of his wives , Rita Hayworth . She was a professional dancer at 12 ; her father partnered her on stage and , according to this book , did far worse to her off it . Screen - tested four years later , she did something nasty to her hairline in the %%interests%% of personal sultriness , and was soon starring with Fred Astaire in You 'll Never Get Rich and You Were Never Lovelier . She proved both wrong , getting richer and lovelier by the hour . This led her into masterpieces like Gilda and The Lady from Shanghai , plus a fistful of failed marriages .
