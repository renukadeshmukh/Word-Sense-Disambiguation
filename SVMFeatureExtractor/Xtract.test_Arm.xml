 Indeed , if the story enacted in a picture is not known , quite wrong inferences can be drawn from what is perceived . The reader of a description needs therefore to be careful about accepting as a description anything more than is actually visible on the canvas or in the sculpture . Within a particular culture , a description can naturally go further in identifying a devout picture of a Virgin and Child , or a dancing figure with six %%arms%% as Siva . The Christian painting may be at once a holy picture and a convincing representation of a woman tenderly cradling her son , seen in front of a north Italian landscape . The Siva statue has no such direct representational reference .

 The Fox in Holgate Road , York was an outstanding beneficiary of the Tetley Heritage Pub initiative of that time . It is a quite perfect example of pub conservation , combining careful preservation of the Victorian compartmented interior and servery arrangement , with judicious enhancement and enlargement of drinking areas . This kind of move came at a time when Tetley 's , along with other %%arms%% of Allied Breweries , espoused and encouraged a culture of well - informed and caring in - house designers . Times change , however , and today , under a somewhat different corporate regime , Heritage starts to smack of yesterday 's fashion , and one is not entirely sure what commitment remains . Already the other Tetley Heritage Pub in York , The Swan , is out on lease to an independent retailing chain .

 AEROBICS ON A SADDLE Having stamina , the ability to keep the body going , means having efficient muscles , good circulation and a strong heart . Exercises which are good for building stamina involve moving your %%arms%% or legs rhythmically . This creates a demand for oxygen , so the heart works a little harder , and the lungs are fully used . They pump oxygen into the bloodstream , so that it passes through the heart and reaches the working muscles .

 If the philosophical discontinuity Foucault describes is truly occurring , then an inside or reflexive exploration of police practice should reveal the strength of these divisive classificatory techniques , for any binary separation of man by his contemporaries into the non - human categories suggested by Leach ( 1982 ) is the very stuff of anthropology . And if such a classificatory system is a major feature of the way the police control their fellow citizens , then it seems essential it should be identified , assessed , and described . Foucault ( 1980 ) , like Thompson ( 1980 ) , asserts that the criminal justice system is increasingly becoming an %%arm%% of the state apparatus , with the institution of policing beginning to wield expanding socio - political power . In a liberal democracy this needs to be scrutinized constantly , and herein lies the first problem for the researcher . For how can one really study a system of state control without acknowledging that such an activity itself is antithetical to the direction of power ?

 Given this premise , we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards ; it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents ' Association conference not only supporting this motion , but arguing for the creation of twenty - four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad . Always the call will be for more power to the organization , so that the 1989 cry of alarm from the Police Federation conference about private security firms is based more on a fear that areas of influence are being taken from the institution than on beliefs that such groups are incompetent . In a similar fashion , all the representative bodies of the police ACPO , the Superintendents ' Association , and the Police Federation were outraged at the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution of Offences Act in the mid - 1980s ; for one area of police power in the courts had been removed at one fell swoop and given to another %%arm%% of the executive . So although in a liberal democracy it would seem practical and even suitable for the police to have a say in the way order is defined and maintained , as Foucault ( 1970 ) and Douglas ( 1987 ) have shown , this will inevitably take on an expansionist line ; for anything other than bland support of the proposals of the institution will present a challenge or pose a threat . This dilemma generates the paradox I have outlined above , where intellectualism and graduate recruitment become prized commodities and are publicly sought after as the organization seeks to elaborate its professionalism , but are simultaneously denigrated .

This hooking action is important because it interferes with the opponent 's attempts to free his %%arm%% and keeps him closed off for a longer period .

 Having said that , if you weigh only 60 kg ( 132 lb ) and yet still manage to sit your 90 kg ( 198 lb ) opponent down with a solid thump to his mid - section , then the refereeing panel may well applaud your fervour with a full point . Obviously , you cannot rely on a hard landing in the case of face punches , so other means must be employed . Even in the case of front %%arm%% jabs , the distance travelled should be maximised and the action demonstrated as a thrust rather than a snap . Many valid front punches are not scored because they travel such short distances at high speed , and are snapped back before the panel can react . A thrusting action should accompany all linear punches and kicks , since it is believed to be related to potential power in a way that a snapping action is not.

 The machine does not need to know anything : it has to perform a task . ( For the functionalist , I should interject , knowledge is decomposable into tasks . ) Robot %%arms%% driven by digital computers can carry out instructions to , say , put a pyramid on the big block even if successful completion of the instructions means first removing a small block from the big one . This is a very sophisticated procedure , but only in the most metaphorical sense would we want to say that the computer has a theory of the external world . ( John Searle , the Reith Lecturer in 1984 , built up a critique of computational psychology around considerations such as these . )

 The pecs respond fairly quickly regular training , especially the bench press . The main function of pecs is to adduct the arms ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body ) , that is they move the upper arms across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion , which draws the %%arm%% forwards and upwards , and shoulder extension , which draws the arm down and forwards . By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle . To develop the pecs fully it is necessary to be aware of how much development there is already , and whether that development is well balanced .

 ( Weights can be attached to the waist to make the dips much harder . ) The use of cables , if available , is excellent for bringing out the definition at the centre of the chest ( origin ) due to the fact that they allow movement over the body 's centre - line without loss of tension . Pectoral decks emphasise the outer part of the pecs near the insertion into the humerus ( upper %%arm%% ) . They also relieve stress on the elbows . If women fully develop the lower pec muscles , the result is that the bust is pushed out by large underlying muscles , thus seeming larger .

 The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint , and they are attached at one end to the upper arm and at the other end to 3 points to the front , top and back of the shoulder . The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front , the side and the rear . All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements , but the direction of the %%arm%% movement determines which head is being used the most . The most impressive shoulder development shows an equal development of all 3 heads of the deltoids . However , this is not very easy to achieve .

 Fig. 6 Back muscles The lateral and posterior heads should always be trained with specific exercises . The best exercise for the lateral deltoid is dumb - bell side - lateral raises ( remember to only raise the %%arms%% to the horizontal because after this the upper trapezius will be used ) , The posterior deltoid is the least enjoyable to train , but should never be missed out . This head is worked hard by bent - over dumb - bell laterals or bent - over cable laterals if a cable cross - over machine is available . It is unlikely that you will need to train the anterior deltoid specifically , but if you do then the straight arm dumb - bell raises to the front are excellent .

 There are 3 heads to the triceps ; 2 of them have their origins on the humerus and the third originates on the shoulder blade . The group has a single tendon insertion below the elbow into the forearm . The function of the triceps is to straighten the arm , therefore at the end of each exercise the %%arms%% should be locked out straight . If this is not done then the full range of triceps movement has not been achieved and full contraction will not be carried out , thus inhibiting development . To develop more size heavy basic exercises must be done , for example close grip bench presses , reverse grip bench presses , dips , push - downs and lying extensions .

 If these definitions were put through a computer they would list five kinds of jumps , twenty - three pas de bourre , seven glissades and so on . The technical structure of each step and pose is known and years of practice in hundreds of class - rooms have produced principles of calm and - spacious movement . But technical descriptions only indicate the positions through which the feet and legs should move and at which moment they should co - ordinate with the %%arms%% as weight is transferred from one step and pose to the next . There are few , if any , suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot , theme and/or music . if choreographers wish to make their design more interesting they should attempt to give each step and pose some distinctive quality or unusual place in the design , which may or may not break the old conventions .

 The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty , just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .

 Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow . It breaks the continuity of the dance . Other practices that once held up the flow of the dance were the continual closing in 5th position before a new step and the continual moving of the %%arms%% through 1st position at every change of weight or during a ports de bras . This last convention is invaluable in early training because it helps to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and is also valuable in such ballets as Birthday Offering as it echoes the period and style of Glazounov 's music . But this would get very boring if used too often .

 Therefore in daily training it is customary for each exercise to be performed to the left and right , forwards and backwards . But even if a choreographer breaks such regularity when setting a classical ballet he usually balances the pattern made on the floor in one enchanement by another moving in the opposite direction . This balancing of floor patterns is also matched by the rise and fall of the dancers ' bodies , heads and %%arms%% . It is very noticeable in Petipa 's ballets , particularly in all the corps de ballet work of The Sleeping Beauty . Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .

 some actors today , notably Sir John Gielgud , use them when playing in classical drama and some eighty are still part of a dancer 's means of telling a story in classical style . They have become part of the spacious ports de bras used during the dance . They conform to the same technical rules as ports de bras and must appear to pass through the centre line of the %%arm%% from shoulder to finger - tips and move within the two circles drawn by the elbows and hands . Two of the best examples occur when the Lilac Fairy casts the spell that sends Aurora to sleep in The Sleeping Beauty , ( Until a prince comes , sees her , falls in love and kisses her awake . ' and when Siegfried swears to marry and save Odette after she has told him how the wicked Von Rothbart turned her into a Swan ( Swan Lake , Act 11 ) .

 In his Scottish dances Bournonville highlighted the Highland characteristic of an upwards lift from the floor on the first beat of a bar whereas in English and French dance the movement is downwards . This makes the Scottish footwork look very light and easy particularly as it is allied to the steps of petit and grand allegro he also used . Another important feature is the absolute co - ordination of the %%arms%% as they change in the ports de bras , often moving through the 1st position . The change usually occurs on the first beat of a bar or phrase , which eliminates any fussiness when the footwork is intricate . Ashton maintained these formal changes in his frivolous Scottish Rhapsody .

 If this is danced to 6/8 it leads to the very swift footwork needed fur Massine 's tarantella and Ashton 's version of the Italian pas de deux in Swan Lake , a miracle of timing and quick changes of auiement . This type of dancing to a dotted rhythm also leads to many steps where the dancers hop continuously on one leg holding the other firmly in attitude devant , retire , or stretched backwards . Like Scottish ports de bras , those of Italy are very simple , the %%arms%% changing places after each sequence of dotted steps or hops . As traditional Italian dances are often sung , the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase . This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .

 However when Fokine staged A Night of Egypt ( later Cleopatra ) he went a great deal further and developed a more particular Eastern style inspired by the performance of some Siamese dancers . He started by sketching numerous frescoes and statuettes he found in the Hermitage Museum , Leningrad . From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the %%arms%% and hands . Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the arms and hands , which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body , very often with a twist sideways at the waist . This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .

But his choreography is no longer like that of earlier demi - caractre styles such as that of the Chinese dance in The Nutcracker .

 This is shown vividly when , left finally alone , she strikes a dramatic pose of complete withdrawal from love and happiness . Dorabella 's playfulness is similar to that of Natalia 's ward , Vera , when she first dances in A Month in the Country , . The carefree quality disappears when she shyly tries to tell the Tutor how fond she has become of him , and when she discovers Natalia and the Tutor in each other 's %%arms%% , she loses all inhibitions to denounce them . Her shy confession of love is in deep contrast to that of Natalia , who cannot wait to show that her emotions are fully aroused when left alone with the same man. It is in these brief intimate scenes that Ashton exploits the difference between youth fulling in love and experience demanding it , because Natalia is used to getting her own way .

 Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile . The angles made at the elbows , shoulders , knees and ankle joints are clearly visible . Those of the %%arms%% are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves . The dancers drawing these straight , angled and very slightly rounded lines have to work accurately and be correctly aligned with their neighbours in each temporary grouping . Each grouping has to be correctly aligned with the other whether it precedes , balances or follows another .

 As US officials produced evidence of his involvement in drug trafficking and appealed for support from other Latin American countries in their campaign to oust him , their case was weakened by evidence that the US had been an important supporter in the general 's rise to power and that the CIA had known about his trafficking for years . Worse were the revelations that the CIA tolerated his activities and had continued to pay him 200,000 ( 125,000 ) a year for at least 10 years . At the same time , General Noriega had been flirting with the Soviet Union and , according to US intelligence sources , continues to receive %%arms%% from Moscow . In spite of the sharp recession induced by US economic sanctions , General Noriega has played a skilful game of counter - propaganda . He accused the US of attempting to destabilise him in order to revoke the Panama Canal treaty signed by the former US president , Jimmy Carter , and the then strongman of Panama , General Omar Torrijos under which control of the canal passes to Panama in the year 2000 .

 For him to blow a kiss to the gallery was one thing . But when last did a politician make such copious use of a handsome wife ? Taking his curtain calls after a successful speech , he drew her to him by the hand and entwined his %%arms%% with hers until she gently shook him off , whereupon he enjoyed his triumph for a while manfully alone , until he again resorted to his wife Glenys , going to fetch her , leading her again by the hand , and holding her by the waist . He had , as it were , taken to heart Labour 's advice to constituency parties on the display of their leaflets and other electioneering wares : Use rose at the correct angle , and do not cut off stem . He had after all had a good conference .

 And the FBI said it had participated only to help fingerprint the victims ; yet there is an FBI report on the incident with over 200 pages blacked out for national security reasons . Arrow Air itself appears to have been involved in the Iran - Contra air supply operation . Don Ewing , director of operations for Arrow , has acknowledged that the company carried %%arms%% from Portugal to the Nicaraguan rebels on at least two occasions in 1984 . And one of Arrow 's pilots , Jacobo Bolivar , was one of the three principals of Sur International , the company which flew weapons from the US to Iran for Lieutenant - Colonel Oliver North in 1985 . We need some people to be made to testify under oath so we can find out what went wrong with that investigation , said Mr Laframboise , stressing that , at this point , it does not matter that most of the physical evidence has been destroyed .

 The time and place for this palace is not fixed , though the women 's hats and swirling frocks remind us both of Dior and Watteau , the men are in chic , futuristic black chiffon . And this shifting between the past and almost - present is equally felt in the choreography it contains some of the cleanest , most authoritative classical dance Page has produced while simultaneously suggesting modern bodies and modern mores in the way the dancers loll negligently on the floor or challenge each other 's strength . On first viewing , the movement is too enjoyably dense to take in fully in old Page - style the head , torso and %%arms%% work in radical counterpoints to the legs , but their opposition is much less clamorous and wilful than before . Where the eye often used to be bruised by hectic entrances and exits , Page now keeps his dancers on the stage , shifting them around in complex patterns or gathering them up in long architectural phrases . Above all there is a new humanity in the work .

 His tinnitus did not , as we had been led to believe , oblige him to spend the concert inside a perspex box ; he leapt across the stage , knees at 90 - degree angles , for much of its three hour span . True , some of the filling - in was performed by a young guitarist in patched jeans , whose contribution was generously acknowledged , but Pete has no trouble playing the guitar . And , most importantly for the lads , judging by the roar which greeted its first appearance , he can still windmill his right %%arm%% . Indeed during the finale , at the rate his arm whirled over his Fender strings , it looked as though he had caught the tail end of Hurricane Hugo during their US tour . Roger Daltrey , all Shirley Temple curls and inflated biceps , swung his microphone dutifully and John Entwistle , in a tatty spiv 's blouson and shock of white hair , stood characteristically immobile , but it was Townshend who looked most chirpy .

 But , against a huge backcloth of mod images , bold arrows and No Entry signs and Union Jacks , beautifully executed songs like Can't Explain ' Substitute and Magic Bus served to remind us how innovative a songwriter Townshend could be . The three best moments of his career were , appropriately , the concert highlights : Won't Get Fooled Again ' 5.15 and , despite the easy jokes , My Generation , whose lyrics still have some pertinence even when sung by a 45 year old . By the encore the chubby middle - aged chap in front of me , like many in the hall , had lost all touch with decorum , and , during Summertime Blues was standing on his seat , windmilling his %%arms%% over the strings of his air guitar . No doubt he will be booking for the 30th Anniversary Tour in 1994 . THEATRE / Storm in a tea - house : Yukio Ninagawa 's productions merge western approaches with eastern ritual .

The French firm is expected to follow the example of Deloitte UK by joining forces with Coopers Lybrand instead . But unlike Deloitte UK , which declined to join the proposed Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu ( DRT ) , the French practice has already signed up.

 In the late 1970s British insurance brokers were takeover targets of their larger rivals in the United States . Then , in the 1980s , overseas financial groups have had large British insurance companies within their sights , which has led to aggressively fought takeovers . The wave of acquisitions has been prompted by expansionist desires among the overseas financial groups , which see opportunities to increase market share and provide themselves , in the case of the acquisition of insurance companies , with new marketing and product design %%arms%% . In some cases , overseas groups have just taken speculative shareholdings in British insurance companies in the hope that their interest may flush out other buyers . The latest , and the largest of the takeovers came last week with the offer of 1.1bn by Australian Mutual Provident , Australia 's largest life insurance company , for Pearl Group , a leading British life insurer .

 By ANDY GLINIECKI WHEELCLAMPING of cars is deterring drivers from parking on yellow lines and illegally parking in residents ' bays , according to a new report . Published by the research %%arm%% of the Department of Transport , the report comes shortly after the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham announced it would be introducing the scheme later this month . So far no local authorities outside London have approached the department about the implementation of wheelclamping . Surveys of parking habits by the deparment 's Transport and Road Research Laboratory carried out before and after wheelclamping was extended to the areas of St John 's Wood and Pimlico in London in spring 1987 , show that parking on yellow lines declined by 31 and 17 per cent respectively .

He told the jurors they should look for corroboration of the 18 - year - old woman 's claim that she had been attacked in the officer 's marked police car . The only corroborative evidence , he suggested , was the bruising to her %%arm%% and legs , which could have been caused by the exertion of force . The judge was summing up at the end of the Old Bailey trial of PC Peter Anderson , 41 , based at Surbiton police station in Surrey , who is accused of raping the woman on 4 April last year . He admits having sexual intercourse with her but denies rape , claiming she instigated the act .

The Secretary of State for Defence roused his audience with a fierce attack on Labour over its Brighton conference decisions on defence and the appearance at a fringe meeting there of Gerry Adams , the Sinn Fein leader . The country should recognise what some members of the new model Labour party were like , Mr King said .

 Nicholas Ridley added to the general glee by saying the Government was in favour of legislation . But few believe the findings of the Law Commission , or government action , will prevent either hacking or computer - related crime . Indeed , there is a strong argument that stretching the long %%arm%% of the law to the innocent hacker could escalate rather than curb serious crime . Emma Nicholson 's Private Member 's Bill against hackers , which failed to make the grade in the last session of Parliament , required anyone who entered a computer to his or anyone else 's advantage , or to another 's prejudice , to be charged with a serious offence , with a maximum penalty of 10 years . The Law Commission has been much more exact in specifying intent to commit serious crime as a necessary ingredient for one of the two more serious offences it proposes .

When government cash was withdrawn they applied to several charitable foundations for funding . The Wellcome Foundation Trust , a charitable %%arm%% of the Wellcome drug company set up to fund medical research , has agreed in principle to a request to pay for the three - year investigation . Peter Williams , director of the trust , confirmed that the trustees had met this week but insisted no decision had yet been taken . There will be a press release next week if discussions are favourably concluded , Dr Williams said .

 The themes that pervade this collection of stories have an appropriate gravity . Behind the latticework of stylistic decorum lurk the preoccupations of a perturbed middle age , urbane , somewhat over - educated , confronting coarseness and spontaneity with the weapons of obliquity and understatement . Parents and children stretch out flailing %%arms%% towards each other in fumbling efforts to communicate . In On The Waves Henry , a divorced father allowed to meet his daughter Melinda in Venice , sits in a gondola meditating on distance , trust and expectation against a background of ruthless infant prattle . The vision which opens His Son , in His Arms , in Light Aloft is that of the father as inescapable pursuer .

Until 31 December individual investors can run the last tax year 's PEP maximum into this year 's quota , and commit up to 7,800 into shares and unit or investment trusts tax - free . To offer the maximum exposure to tax - free collective investment , managers must be able to provide old PEPs ( ie have started PEPs in the tax year 1988 - 89 ) plus new PEPs which run in this tax year .

 Other stalling techniques are also deployed to detain them in the station on such days ( prolonging station business , extended conversations in parts of the station where they are less visible to management , carrying messages , and so on ) . But , as a general principle , Northern Ireland 's social divisions ensure that police management prefer neighbourhood police to be on the street , as is their purpose , and in practice about three - quarters of the normal shift is taken up with beat duty , which is much higher than in Great Britain . But there is a reverse to this , for wider security concerns require that neighbourhood men accomplish community policing equipped with at least a side - %%arm%% , sometimes more , flak jacket and baton , as well as personal radio . For some calls they wear plain clothes , but mostly work is done in uniform , as it must be if neighbourhood policing is to work . Moreover , each patch has to be walked by two men : one providing cover for the other while he polices his beat , so that each spends only half of the shift on their particular area .

 The constant mortaring and shelling of the area had dislodged a few of the corpses and the flies and mosquitoes were everywhere .

At the Saulnier farm ( 6 Commando area ) I washed my %%arm%% in the cattle trough but could not get rid of the smell . Looking around the cobbled farmyard and at the farm buildings , the shelling and mortaring that went on during the attack on Breville had taken its toll .

Someone in the column seemed to recognise me ; he was shouting and waving his %%arms%% . You are a long way from Achnacarry , Piper ! Have you come to march us in ?
