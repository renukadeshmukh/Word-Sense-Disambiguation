 Planning was often difficult or impossible and the need for home care was less . The commonest cause of death is now advanced Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( a kind of cancer ) . Slowly growing internal lesions can produce great %%difficulties%% in the lung and the gut , causing shortness of breath and other problems . Internal Kaposi 's Sarcoma can be very painful .

 Her college library has interesting books , as well as the latest art magazines . Her course teacher has given her a reading list , and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests . As part of the course , she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ; one of her %%difficulties%% is to know how to form her own views , not just copy already received opinions . She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ; it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic , since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome , and although there were plenty of books about it , many of them went into extravagant detail . Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo , and has a route map prepared , including introductory and background books , but also passages from longer scholarly works .

 For example , this is a passage of interpretive description of a Van Gogh self - portrait : his emaciated , luminous head with its burning eyes set off against a whirlpool of darkness . I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize , Van Gogh had written , groping to define for his brother the human essence that was his aim in pictures such as this . In other passages , the reader may find more %%difficulty%% in following Janson 's judgement . Here is a passage which shows that a survey can benefit from being used with other books ( even though three of the sculptures mentioned are illustrated by Janson ) . Antoine Coysevox , a less self - conscious classicist than Girardon , was another sculptor employed by Lebrun at Versailles .

 These functions have been well carried out by Baedeker guides since the foundation of the German firm in the first part of the nineteenth century . Old copies are now collectors items , with their entertaining instructions and hints . In 1909 : The unattached cyclist on entering Italy with his wheel must deposit 42 fr . 60c . with the custom - house authorities , which sum is returned to him ( though seldom without %%difficulties%% ) when he quits the country . Baedeker acquired a reputation for serious standards , and the traveller who missed a double - asterisked attraction had clearly journeyed in vain . Baedeker in 1909 , like Reynolds in his fifth discourse , hesitated between two great masters and their works .

 I must admit therefore that there is one passage in this otherwise consummate design ( A Fruit Dish ) of which the meaning escapes me . I cannot see the necessity of the shadow cast by a half - opened drawer in the kitchen table . , It is encouraging to find Fry underlining a point about critical writing that with a description of a work of art it can be useful to be given an explicit account of how the critic responds . Another point is also made explicitly . : his %%difficulty%% is assessing Czanne 's work at the end of the century . It is more difficult to be precise about this than about the earlier phases , partly because the pictures are rarer and less accessible , and have not been adequately photographed , partly because it includes considerable variations . Fry 's book contains rather little biographical information , the focus being firmly on Czanne 's work .

 The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies , and published in 1951 . the strength of the gallery 's holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author 's while to write a preliminary note about difficulties of attribution : A definition of Bellini 's oeuvre is one of the hardest problems in the history of painting . The first %%difficulty%% is , despite the destructions , the enormous number of existing pictures , many of them signed , and in one way or another more or less Bellinesque . It is obvious that Bellini had assistants to help him in his studio ; indeed , there is documentary proof of that . But the question of what pictures are entirely or for practical purposes Bellini 's own is answered largely by personal taste ; there is therefore a considerable divergence of view .

 A climate of artistic opinion is as tricky to predict as the English weather , and also quite as changeable . Both writers and readers are affected by generally accepted ideas , without necessarily having given them independent thought . One %%difficulty%% in describing a climate of opinion is this fact : that many shared views are not stated openly , but assumed . A set of assumptions may be challenged by an outsider , and at this moment these shared views come into focus . To look at the work of an art critic in this way we have to turn to historians of taste for the past and to journalists for the present .

 That is better still ! David was greatly encouraged by this warm admiration expressed by a celebrated man , and it helped to develop his talent . Reviews of exhibiting societies ' shows have constantly presented %%difficulties%% to critics , as it is only possible to give brief comments on some of the artists ' work ; how could it be otherwise when an exhibiting society shows several thousand works ? During the nineteenth century to be noticed was good fortune , while to be praised was a professional advantage . Exhibiting societies , once established , bred rivals ; the most remarkable rivalry in the nineteenth century was in Paris , where the choice of pictures for the Salon in 1866 was so generally considered to be unfair that the rejected pictures were shown in a Salon of their own .

 In The Emperor he writes : For the starvelings it had to suffice that His Munificent Highness personally attached the greatest importance to their fate , which was a very special kind of attachment , of an order higher than the highest . It provided the subjects with a soothing and uplifting hope that whenever there appeared in their lives an oppressive mischance , some tormenting %%difficulty%% , His Most Unrivalled Highness would hearten them by attaching the greatest importance to that mischance or difficulty . The Emperor has something of the technique of comic and fantastic exaggeration that we associate with Dickens , and something of the manner , too , of Dickens 's reader , Kafka : In the courtyard where the Emperor s retinue awaited him , there were tens , no , I say it without exaggeration , hundreds eager to push their faces forward .

 But this , too , is upper - class , this recital of exotic place - names so often the spoor of the doughty , ascetic , astringent English traveller who has left his privileges behind . As the years go by , Ursula 's body becomes a bore , and she experiences a fear of ageing : I shall have to die fairly young , because I wo n't be able to live with the infirmities of old age . She is indeed ready to die , and it is a %%difficulty%% that Justin may feel that he has to do the same . In the Sudan she declares : My time is up. She is infatuated with a handsome police chief , goes rather grimly to bed with him in the time he can spare from gambling sessions , and then kills herself .

 She displays more sympathy for this anti - Semitic Moses , for this religious man who is against Jews and against the Soviet system , than she does for Jews who are not religious . Whether or not she has talked to God , she has certainly been reviewing for him. Levi , the expert on metals , would have had no %%difficulty%% in telling the difference between gold and tin . I have heard that he was saddened by these writings of Fernanda Eberstadt 's , in which his own writings are faulted . Two months after the Herling piece was published Levi committed suicide , throwing himself down the staircase of the house in Turin where he was born and grew up , where he wrote about his life in the camp at a desk which stood where his cradle had stood , a house he shared with his wife and mother .

 A play really demands to be read aloud - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive . It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage . Surprisingly , this is true of both the classical and modern play , though you might expect that the obscurities and %%difficulties%% of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in , say , Shakespeare or Ben Jonson . Here is a suggested first reading list , which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's development . There is a danger in reading the classics , in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature so always try to look at them as plays for performance and , it goes without saying , try to see as much theatre as you can .

 Questions of Morality and Christian Virtue aside , she did n't really blame all the women Henry Phipps had conquered for succumbing to his wiles . Life in a small village could be deadly dull , and Henry had been absolutely charming when he chose to be . The %%difficulty%% was , he 'd chosen to be charming so very , very often . Why , even Peggy herself had been one of his targets until he realized there was no chance for him there . If David had ever learned of the things Phipps had said to her , he would probably

 I leave the weed in the pool untouched until the frogs have departed . Then I pull some of it out to clear a bit of space . The %%difficulty%% is that every handful of weed that 's pulled out is likely to contain its fair share of aquatic creatures too . However insignificant , they still do n't deserve to be thrown out with the bathwater , or rather the pond water . So , I pull handfuls of weed and leave it near the water 's edge , giving at least some of the creatures the chance to nip back into the water again .

 This applies during any cross wind take - off . It also applies during the landing itself and the ground run , whether the wing - down or crabbing method is being used . As with all flying , anticipation prevents %%difficulties%% arising . At the start of the cross wind take - off apply full rudder in anticipation of the swing into wind , and then reduce it as soon as it becomes effective . Get the wing - tip holder to keep the down wind wing - tip high and apply a little aileron to prevent it falling during the first part of the take - off run .

 Jewish tradition said this about the education of the child : Scripture at five ; Mishnah ( that is , the explanation of the scriptures ; mishnah means repetition ) at 10 ; Bar Mitzvah at 13 . And so Leonard , from an early age , at home and at Hebrew school , was brought to the source of his faith . Academically , he was a bright pupil , though it would appear he had %%difficulties%% in concentrating on the day - to - day routines perhaps through boredom , often an indication of the brighter child . One recollection of Leonard 's concerns his reciting a prayer at Synagogue , which he got wrong . Instead of the authorised prayer , he recited one for the dead .

 I have declined to act as external examiner to candidates whose subject or thesis title seemed to be so dubious that a successful treatment of it could only be done by a candidate of exceptional brilliance ; in such cases it is likely that the candidate has had inadequate or misguided supervision . In a busy life , it is easier to avoid embarrassment than to have to extricate oneself from it . Much %%difficulty%% could be avoided if the only candidates permitted to work for a PhD were those who were virtually certain to obtain it , but that is not a feasible option in the modern university . Similar considerations make me sometimes decline to examine students from foreign parts . This is not because of xenophobia , still less racism ; prudence is the principal consideration .

 The problems are not universal , one must emphasize . Some students , particularly those from the Indian subcontinent who have been selected for Commonwealth Scholarships , are capable of performing very well at higher degree level , and then returning to an academic career in their own countries . When overseas students do present %%difficulties%% and I am sure many academics will be familiar with distressing or scandalous cases it is not because they are lacking in industry or intellectual ability . Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency , like linguistics or economics or marketing . But in this respect , at least , English in the English academy , as Leavis liked to emphasize , is not just another subject .
